# 7381project
*************************************
* This is a team project.
* Using Verilog, expand the design of the basic ALU of our previous Verilog homework assignment to handle integer multiply operations. 
* Add appropriate registers and other hardware as needed. 
* Assume 32-bit twoâ€™s-complement numbers will be used, same as for the current ADD and SUB operations. 
* Test using both positive and negative integer numbers.
